# Soledad Tancredi

Hey ! I'm a Java Backend developer.

### I enjoy working with SpringBoot and crafting beautiful front-end experiences with Angular & React.

I consider myself a very proactive person, responsible, self-taught, and a fast learner ðŸš€

I love work with new teams and I'm always ready to face new challenges
